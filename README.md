CHIP8-Emulator
==============
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for said computers.

Roughly twenty years after CHIP-8 was introduced, derived interpreters appeared for some models of graphing calculators (from the late 1980s onward, these handheld devices in many ways have more computing power than most mid-1970s microcomputers for hobbyists).


#Registers
CHIP-8 has 16 8-bit data registers named from V0 to VF. The VF register doubles as a carry flag.

#Timers
CHIP-8 has two timers. They both count down at 60 hertz, until they reach 0.
